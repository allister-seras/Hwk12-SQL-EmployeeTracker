  ## Useage
  This project allows for users to track departments, roles, and employees. Users are able to seed it with their own data or update the information as needed. Once they've downloaded the application, they can run the program from the console/terminal. They are met with 8 options, the first 3 are to view the current information within the employee_db database. Following those options 4-6 are to add any additional depeartments, roles, and employees. Option 7 is availble should a user need to update an employee, such as when they are promoted, the user is able to change their role. Option 8 provides a simple an easy way to shut down the program once you are done.
